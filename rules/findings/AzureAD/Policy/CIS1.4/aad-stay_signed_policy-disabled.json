    "displayName":  "Ensure the option to stay signed in is disabled",
    "description":  "The option for the user to `Stay signed in` or the `Keep me signed in` option will prompt a user after a successful login, when the user selects this option a persistent refresh token is created. Typically this lasts for 90 days and does not prompt for sign-in or Multi-Factor.",
    "rationale":  "Allowing users to select this option presents risk, especially in the event that the user signs into their account on a publicly accessible computer/web browser. In this case anyone with access to the profile said users utilized would have access to their account when directing the web browser to office.com.",
    "impact":  "Once you have changed this setting users will no longer be prompted upon sign-in with the message `Stay signed in?`. This may mean users will be forced to sign in more frequently. Important: some features of SharePoint Online and Office 2010 have a dependency on users remaining signed in. If you hide this option, users may get additional and unexpected sign in prompts.",
    "remediation":  "
