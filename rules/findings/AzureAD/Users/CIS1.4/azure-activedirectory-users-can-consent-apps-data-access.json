    "description":  "Consider to prevent regular users from consenting to applications on their own behalf. Once this feature is disabled, an administrator will be required to consent to any new application a user needs to use.",
    "rationale":  "Unless Microsoft Entra ID is running as an identity provider for third-party applications, do not allow users to use their identity outside of the cloud environment. User profiles contain private information such as phone numbers and email addresses which could then be sold off to other third parties without requiring any further consent from the user.",
    "impact":  "It might be an additional request that administrators need to fulfill quite often.",
